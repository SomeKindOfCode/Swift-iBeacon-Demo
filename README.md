Beacon Demo
===========

This is just a very basic sample app to show you, how to work with iBeacons with Swift.

Information
-----------

This App is build with XCode 6 Beta 4!
To reconstruct everything in your app, make sure to enable the Bluetooth LE support and Location Updates in the capabilities tab of your target. This setting is found in the "Background Modes" Section.

The AppDelegate just handles the backgrounding of the beacon localization to react on entering and exiting the beacons range.

Most of the code can be found in the `ViewController.swift`.
Please enter the UUID of your iBeacon here to make it work properly.
